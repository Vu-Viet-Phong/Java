    <center><h1>The Little Boat</h1></center>
    <p>The storm tossed the little boat like a cheap sneaker in an old washing machine. The three
    drunken fishermen were used to such treatment, of course, but not the tree salesman, who even as
    a stowaway now felt that he had overpaid for the voyage.</p>

      <li>What color is the boat?</li>
      <li>And what about Naomi?</li>
