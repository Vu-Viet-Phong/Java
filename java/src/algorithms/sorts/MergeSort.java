/**
 * Merge sort (also commonly spelled as mergesort) is an efficient, 
 * general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most 
 * implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order 
 * of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort 
 * is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von 
 * Neumann in 1945.
